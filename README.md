# Numerical_Method_for_economists
Here are the codes for my exam in the course "Numerical Methods for Economists."
I had to replicate the results obtained by a researcher in a paper.
I have uploaded both my Python codes and a PDF explanation of the codes.
Please note that this PDF file does not display any charts (likely due to GitHub policies). If you wish to view the results, please run the code.
